  (FORMAT 3,SEND THIS ONE WHEN HIS THINKING ABOUT YOU)
Hello dear,
How are you doing right now overthere, how was ur night? How have u been doing and how is life treating you now,i guess u are doing pretty nice overthere today,well its so nice to share alot of feelings with you , well i have imagined u as a nice person and as a caring person too, and i am so much liking what i get to read from you, cause u really know what you want in a relationship, i know life hasnt been easy in the past for any one cause we just want to struggle from the buttom to the top cause no one wants to remain below his demands, well i get to see some things in your words which made me write u and ur personality speaks alot about you, cause u realy know how to describe urself and the things u want inlife, well nice try, you really know who u really are and thats what i mean by self personality,its just all about you knowing who u realy are and the things u do to make u a happy man, ur words are short but meaningful cause at least u could write something about yourself,and i know u could  say more in person or write more with the aid of u wanting to express yourselfs, what really do u think of yourself and who do u see urself as,and what are ur dreams and what kind of things do u do to urself that makes u think u could be  a special person, or do u have to share ur personality with somone before u can really can know how special u are to poeple, i assume u are the gift of God and God has blessed you with alot in life all u just need is to focus on things around you and the poeple around you to know what God has in stock for you, how do u go about making a life meaning full for you and how do u try to make others smile by u considering how special you are.
Before a person could  think of caring for someone u have to know how special u are to poeple and how caring u cud be, its doesnt matter by you really knowing that person ,God might send you to that person for an help and u will be willing to help but it just take time cause the world is never a safe place anymore and there is alot to learn about poeple,i my self i have learn alot from my environment, the things i do and the things i try not to do,i just sit and listen to music read books and make my life meaningfull to me and try to be honest about the whole thing i do, cause honesty is only the key to human succes and it makes life meaningfull if u can apply all the principles of been a special person to poeple,every day people die and everyday a new one is been born, so we all want to be in a safe place but we dont really know how to go about been there, cause we havent really leanred about the principles of life, life is full of joy if u can discover the joy inside of you,life doesnt begin from your environment, it begins from inside of you,cause life begins if u can began it with a very first step and a very first chance.
If life goes on with one thing there will be another thing that might destroy it, so we just try not to fall a victim of circumstances,i have been through alot of things in life but that didnt make me to do any silly things in life,it only makes me stronger in alot of things cause i learn not to put my problems in my head cause if u do it will just weigh u down and it wont allow u think of better things to make ur life meaningful, so i just want to make my life meaningful and use it in helping others and its all about me taking a chance to do what i have to do to make the world a loving place and to make poeple know that there is so much love inside of them to use in helping change the world, life goes on if u began with something real and sincere and u learn to focus about it, and learn to see the principles that quides it,life is been guide with alot of principles leading to the truth of life and love,the earth alone is filled with so much love but we humans made it hidden cause of the bad things that we thought is good, If we only can learn to bring out the love of life and the life of love and get to make the world a place to live then every one dont have to get scared of each other, cause i have been into alot of things i have tried alot of things and it didn't really work out for me cause i cant really cheat on my feelings or judge myself for the things i do,I just want to make alot of things come to reality by me focusing on them and wanting it to come to reality , i just want to make people happy with my kind of personality and the wisdom God has given me and i want to make others smile while i make myself smile to as well,there are more things we Still need to learn about ourself, If only u can have a time to relax and focus on ur thought and have a deep imagination about the whole thing happening in the world,if only u can do that, u will get to see the Good and Bad things on earth and that will surelly keep u out of trouble, cause u decided to focus on building urself in way that cud help you and help others,the reason why we are in the world is to be here for one and other and to help when we are in need, but this generation that i have seen has turned to something else,there is alot of hatered, crime, greed, jealousy,self centerned and fornication,all this didnt creat or started in one day it all started from individials cause they just wanted to make life meaningless for them self and satisfy there immidiate needs, life begans inside of us and we need to learn about the way of life to make it meaningful for us.
My words might sound too prophetic but my life is all about the tought and i mean all i say and do and i really want to start a family i can grow older with and with a man i will do love with all my heart, i do sincerelly know wat love means to me and others and i go about building it in the right way if only my partner is ready to start a strong and fullfilled relationship..I really feel the music of your words and my heart sings the same rythem and i know we will both be happy someday and i do have alot of faith in your words cause they are words of truth and u are completlly honest about it.Im not here to judge your past but i am here to build the present and show u the personalities love has and the realy person inside of you..If u find it so hard discovering the real person in you i am here filled with so much music for you which you cud dance to...i know someday i will be great and will be so special to alot of people but i wanna take life the way i see and meet it..but i can only change situations..no situaion is permanent.we both can change it..forget about the present and think of the beauty of the presnt and build on it and u will surelly see the music in you...
I will tell you more about life and marriage if u want to listen to it and u will be so happy to read my emails cause my words come deep down from my heart and i speak them and put them to words cuase i am confident of my self and i am not afriad of who i am with time u will learn alot about who u really are cause i am just like an angel on to you and i know ur life will be so wonderfull been with me..marriage is a life time commitment to me and we will build on that someday sometime.
 
Have a nice and lovelly day and take good care of your family and tell them someone real and special is coming into your word soon.

feel what u feel makes me grow in spirit with you, it make me know the next step towards you, i like what i hear and feel, and i know my imagination will come to reality someday, i have strong feelings for you and i know we wont both
let each other down, i know we are both from different culture and backgrounds, but it doesn't affect the fact that we both seek for each other in each others heart,we are both seeking for true love and i know we have found it casue its all about me and you,but no one else, we can do it and i belive in you and ur words,no one can make our happiness come true, its right in me and you, u can explore it right out when u feel so loved by a man, i am so happy we both found each other, why i am so attracted to you is that, the words you say is more than u typing into computers those words are full of inspiration and and its comes striaght into my tought and it just well in my heart.
 
I feel so safe and secure and i have perfect confident in you,u are just like a princess unto me, just like someone i cud love so much with all my heart,despite the fact that we cant even see each others face and touch each other and we still trust and feel each others heart,what a wonderfull moment we have heard online together.

i want to say something, beauty is not based on how attractive we are to everybody else, but how attractive we are to ourselves, for one cannot think other people think they are full of beauty unless they know they are beautiful too and I believe the personality and the soul is what makes a person beautiful, it does not always have to be the physical appearance.
The beauty of love is to look into your eyes, and see the love you feel for me, to see the way you feel and the way you care, that is why I really wanna be there for you and love you. Do not belittle or disregard those who are different than you, for without them you would cease to be special,cause without others u cant know how special you are to them and how special u are and the future belongs to those who
believe in the beauty of their dreams. My heart speaks about the beauty of love and i want to share every moment with you,i know it will be a dream come true but i know u do believe and have faith in my words and u wont regret an inch every loving me
 
Have a lovelly day and take good care of yourself and tell them once again that an Angel is coming into your life forever and i will be there till death do us path.

  These are lovely poetic thought about what love is:
Love is like a river, never ending as it flows, but gets greater with time
 
Love is like swallowing hot chocolate before it has cooled off. It takes you by surprise at first, but keeps you warm for a long time.
 
Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end.
 
Love is a journey not a destination
 
Love is a precious gift that you receive, and you need to give it with caution
 
Love is happiness given back and forth
 
Love is the only game never postponed due to darkness
 
Love is too strong a word to say it too early, but it has too beautiful a meaning to say it too late.
 
Love is a noble act of self-giving, offering trust, faith, and loyalty. The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don't become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones.
 
Love is in your heart not to stay, but to be shared.
 
Love is like salted water; the more you drink the more your thirst increases
 
Love is when there are a million things you want to say to someone, but when they look you in the eyes and hold you in their arms nothing in life matters other than being with that person at that moment.
 
Love is like the air we breathe. It may not always be seen, but it is always felt, used and needed.
 
Love is not a feeling it's a sensation

How are u doing today, hope fine, i am still waiting to hear from u, just said i should know how u are feeling, take care of urself and remember that i care so much about u. Sleep tight.
These are lovely poetic thought about what love is:
Love is like a river, never ending as it flows, but gets greater with time
 
Love is like swallowing hot chocolate before it has cooled off. It takes you by surprise at first, but keeps you warm for a long time.
 
Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end.
 
Love is a journey not a destination
 
Love is a precious gift that you receive, and you need to give it with caution
 
Love is happiness given back and forth
 
Love is the only game never postponed due to darkness
 
Love is too strong a word to say it too early, but it has too beautiful a meaning to say it too late.
 
Love is a noble act of self-giving, offering trust, faith, and loyalty. The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don't become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones.
 
Love is in your heart not to stay, but to be shared.
 
Love is like salted water; the more you drink the more your thirst increases
 
Love is when there are a million things you want to say to someone, but when they look you in the eyes and hold you in their arms nothing in life matters other than being with that person at that moment.
 
Love is like the air we breathe. It may not always be seen, but it is always felt, used and needed.
 
Love is not a feeling it's a sensation
 
Love is a box waiting to be opened by the right recipient
 
Love is when you find yourself spending every wish on her
 
Love is not to be purchased and affection has no price
 
Love is like a flower, give it some time, patience and lots of tender loving care; and watch it bloom into something wonderful before your eyes.
 
Love is knowing you are the bud from which his happiness blossoms.
 
Love is like the weather, sometimes it forces you to withdraw even when you don't want to stay inside. While other times it is the best of times and you keep yourself inside.
 
Love is like a rose, the special one grows in the winter
 
Love is what you make it and with whom you make it; it is what it is
 
Love is the passion that we feel inside of our hearts that we can't hide. We pretend to hide it, but it burns us more and more until the pain grows and grows and it never ends
 
If love is music in its purest form, then you are the notes on the page and the melody in my heart
 
 
Love is so powerful
***** Please attach some of ur pics so that i can see u and ur lovely smile....lol*****
